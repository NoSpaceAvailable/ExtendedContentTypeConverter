<p>This extended version of BAppstore's content type converter converts data submitted within requests between various common
formats: JSON, XML, x-www-form-urlencoded and multipart/form-data</p>
<p>This is useful for discovering vulnerabilities that can only be found by converting the content type of request. For example, if
an original request submits data using JSON, we can attempt to convert the data 
to XML, to see if the application accepts data in XML form. If so, we can then 
look for vulnerabilities like XXE injection which would not arise in the context 
of the original JSON endpoint. It might also be possible to find vulnerabilities 
behind web application firewalls or other filters that assume the incoming data 
is in a specific format, while the application tolerates data in other formats.</p>

<p>Requires Java version 17 or above.</p>
